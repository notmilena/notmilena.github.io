      <p>My life...what can I say about it ? So far I would consider myself an uninteresting person I mean like I have a pretty basic everyday routine,wake up for the everyday morning commute of school.Then there's like my life academic wise I would consider myself a pretty good student except for chemistry.My friends are pretty cool too I guess...except Joseph because he's too extra sometimes but he's still one of my best friends.I got a D in chemistry the 3rd nine weeks of school, but I finished with a final grade of a B and that's great cause chemistry was awful(?)is that how you spell it ? that's weird right? like seeing a word and like you know it's spelled right, but it looks weird so you question your life decisions.I'm getting off topic so here's some basic facts about me , I was born November 24th,I'm allergic to cats,I'm seventeen and still don't have my license, but I can drive I just get lazy to go take the driving test and stuff like that would require me leaving my bed and idk about that. My friend Alyssa graduated this year she's leaving to New Haven hopefully she does good in college and becomes the surgeon she want's to be. Another fact about me is that I don't really know what I want to do, I like this whole technology and computer science thing but I also like to draw lowkey (I'm not that good at it though but like I try). I also like to listen to music and write but lately I haven't written as much I would wrte stories and stuff back in middle school like 4 years ago? (wow I'm old), That's another thing everyone says I don't look as old as I am I mean that's kinda cool cause if I don't grow then I can pass as a 20 year old when I'm 30 or something idk that's what my mom told me I don't look like her though.... This biography thing is heading south now so I'm just ending this here...okay cool.</p>

      <p>Heyyyyyy it's me again (obviously cause this is my blog)
         so these are my top 5 things that I like:

         1- Food, specifically chipotle cause chipotle is everythingggggg
         2- Music, I listen to any music really I don't follow a specific             artist or band but I'm pretty open to anything.
         3- Youtube, I love youtube and watching all kinds of youtubers               like youtube is really cool because you can find anything on
            there my favorite youtuber is David Dobrik because his vlogs
            are really funny and different.
         4- Netflix,I really like to watch Netflix shows currently OITNB
            has been one of my favorites (if only I could finish it)
         5- Traveling,I like to travel and not just going on vacation but
            just in general I love to explore and find new places near me
            I love the beach too because there's always something to do.

  <div class="w3-container">
    <p>So this is what I don't like it's not much so I might just do like top 3 things I hate so yeah here we go:
    1- Loud stuff when I'm trying to sleep, Listen... my mom is one of those people to vaccum when I'm trying to take a nap or sleep and it's just so like asdjnfhfrfvjnffwdj basically
    2- My mom calling my name and not answering- Basically my mother once again with her antics she calls my name, I respond, no response.... now I have to get up and go see why she called me and it's a daily occurance that I could go without
    3- School- I like school sometimes but honestly having to wake up at 6 am and sitting in a class for 2 hours I really think that recess should be a thing again or like a designated nap time cause like who's honestly awake and ready to learn at 7 in the morning ?????
    4- The woods I really hate the woods and the outdoors because it's hot and humid and bugs and dirt and sweat is just horrible if I lived in a place that wasn't humid then maybe it'd be diffrent.
